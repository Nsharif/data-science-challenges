There are three different data science challenge files. Uber: which contains spline regression models, Instacart: which contains data visualization and eda, and Cogitativo: which contains eda and a series of ensemble method algorithims (bagging, boosting, xgboost).

Each file contains an R code along with an attached report/presentation.
